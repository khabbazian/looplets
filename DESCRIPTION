Description: It decomposes the graph into loops of size three, four and so on. It is useful to investigate the structure of large graphs. The algorithm uses breath first search approach to count loops of size k where all the edges of the loop do not belong to a loop of size less than k. The algorithm iterates over k=3,4,... until there is no loop  or reaches the loop length upper bound.
